# Connect Four Game - Developer Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to my Connect Four project documentation. This web-based version of the classic Connect Four game is designed to be interactive, responsive, and user-friendly. The project encapsulates modern web development practices with a focus on modular architecture and efficient state management, ensuring a seamless gameplay experience across various devices.

## Project Structure
The project is structured into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, each serving distinct roles:

### HTML
- **index.html**: Serves as the entry point of the game. It organizes the game's layout including the main menu, game grid, and rule screen. It links to the CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.

### CSS
- **main.css**: Imports other CSS files and manages global styles.
- **fonts.css**, **general.css**, **components.css**, **layout.css**: These files collectively style the game, ensuring it is visually appealing and functionally responsive. They define fonts, general element styles, specific components, and the overall layout responsiveness.
  
### JavaScript
The JavaScript files utilize ES6 modules to separate concerns:
- **Game.js**: Acts as the game engine. It initializes the game, handles the logic for player turns, disc dropping, win checks, and manages game state transitions.
- **Grid.js**: Manages the game board data, calculating valid moves, storing disc positions, and checking for winning conditions.
- **View.js**: Manages all direct interactions with the DOM. It updates the game's visual components in response to state changes in `Game.js`.
- **Control.js**: Handles user inputs through event listeners, allowing players to interact with the game via mouse or keyboard.
- **Navigation.js**: Controls navigation between different parts of the game like menus and the game board itself, handling the transitions and state visibility.
- **helpers.js**: Provides utility functions to simplify DOM selection and iterative operations.

## How the Files Work Together
1. **HTML and CSS Integration**: The HTML file serves as the scaffold, defining the structure. CSS files are then applied to this structure, styling each component from the broad layout down to specific elements like buttons and the game grid.

2. **JavaScript Interaction**:
   - **Control Flow**: `Control.js` captures and manages user input, interacting directly with `Game.js` to affect the game state.
   - **Game Logic**: `Game.js` uses `Grid.js` to handle the logical representation of the game board and to determine game outcomes based on player actions.
   - **View Updates**: `View.js` listens to changes in game state from `Game.js` and updates the DOM accordingly, ensuring the player always has a current view of the game state.
   - **Navigation**: `Navigation.js` provides seamless transitions between different views like the main menu, game view, and rules screen, enhancing the user experience without reloading the page.

## Result
This Connect Four game is a full-featured web application that allows two players to compete in a classic game or against a computer opponent. It is designed to be visually engaging, easy to navigate, and accessible on multiple devices thanks to its responsive design. The modular JavaScript architecture allows for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Conclusion
This Connect Four project not only reinforced my skills in web development but also provided a fantastic learning experience in the complexities of game development. Throughout this project, I enjoyed exploring and implementing features like AI logic, responsive design, and state management, which deepened my understanding and appreciation of both front-end and game development.

### What I Learned:
- **Advanced JavaScript Techniques**: Working with ES6 modules helped me better organize and structure code, making it more maintainable and scalable.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the game looks and performs well on different devices was both challenging and rewarding, enhancing my skills in CSS and adaptive layouts.
- **Game Logic Implementation**: Developing the game's logic, from tracking player turns to determining win conditions, improved my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

### Future Enhancements:
- **Improved AI Opponent**: Introducing a more sophisticated AI using algorithms like Minimax could provide a more challenging experience for players.
- **Multiplayer Online Feature**: Implementing real-time multiplayer capabilities using WebSockets or a similar technology to allow players to compete against others online.
- **Customizable Themes and Boards**: Adding options for users to customize board colors and piece designs could enhance personalization and user engagement.

This project was not only a significant stepping stone in my development career but was a fun experience. I look forward to evolving the game further and implementing the above enhancements to make Connect Four even more engaging and challenging.
